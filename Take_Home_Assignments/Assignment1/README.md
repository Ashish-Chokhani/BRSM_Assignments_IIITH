# Assignment 1 – Sampling Distributions

This assignment demonstrates the **Central Limit Theorem** and **sampling variability** through simulations.

## 📌 Objectives

- Simulate sampling distributions from:
  - Normal distribution `N(100, 15)`
  - Beta distribution `Beta(2, 5)`
- Observe how sample size affects mean estimates and spread
- Plot confidence intervals for different group sizes
- Explain behavior of confidence intervals with respect to sample size

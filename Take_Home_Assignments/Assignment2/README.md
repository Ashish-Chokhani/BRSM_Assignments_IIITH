# Assignment 2 – Multiple Comparisons & Permutation Tests

This assignment explores **multiple hypothesis testing corrections** and **non-parametric significance testing** using permutations.

## 📌 Objectives

1. Apply **Bonferroni** and **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)** corrections to a set of p-values.
2. Perform **permutation tests** on:
   - Mosquito attraction post-beer consumption
   - Correlation between IQ and test scores
3. Visualize adjusted p-values and permutation distributions
4. Interpret statistical significance and hypothesis decisions
